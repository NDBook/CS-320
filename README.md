Software Test Automation, QA


I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by limiting the amount of input characters permitted when querying the user for input.  Another method would be use handled exceptions to indicate when variables fall outside of the predefined parameters.  The best way to interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program is to itemize the requirements and write code to fulfill those requirements one step at a time.  My new approach to designing software has me more concerned with validating input and throwing exceptions.  This proved to be extremely helpful when performing tests on my code.  Being able to create test functions for classes I wrote will ensure my code meets the standards defined by the stakeholders.
